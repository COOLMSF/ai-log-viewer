- ✅ Demo mode when DeepSeek API key not configured
- ✅ Analysis suggestions based on log content
- ✅ Custom question input for specific analysis
- ✅ Proper error handling and user feedback

### 4. Backend API Functionality
- ✅ File upload endpoint (/api/logs/upload)
- ✅ File listing endpoint (/api/logs/files)
- ✅ Log parsing endpoints (/api/parser/*)
- ✅ AI analysis endpoints (/api/analysis/*)
- ✅ Configuration status endpoint (/api/analysis/config)

### 5. Frontend UI/UX

- Apache access logs (Common Log Format)
- Generic text logs
- Kubernetes logs (parser ready)
- MySQL logs (parser ready)
- Docker logs (parser ready)

## AI Analysis Features
- General log analysis with issue detection
- Security concern identification
- Performance issue detection
- Configuration problem analysis
- Pattern recognition
- Actionable recommendations
- Demo mode for users without API keys

## Technical Architecture
- Backend: Python Flask with SQLAlchemy
- Frontend: React with Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- Database: SQLite for development
- AI Integration: DeepSeek API (OpenAI-compatible)
